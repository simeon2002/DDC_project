TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/FSM_VGA_all_0/inst/FSM_VGA_inst/w_iBoundary_hor_reg/L7 (in design_1_i/FSM_VGA_all_0/inst/FSM_VGA_inst/w_iBoundary_hor_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/FSM_VGA_all_0/inst/FSM_VGA_inst/w_iBoundary_hor_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/FSM_VGA_all_0/inst/FSM_VGA_inst/w_iBoundary_vert_reg/L7 (in design_1_i/FSM_VGA_all_0/inst/FSM_VGA_inst/w_iBoundary_vert_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/FSM_VGA_all_0/inst/FSM_VGA_inst/w_iBoundary_vert_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
